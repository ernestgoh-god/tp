# ScheduleFlow User Guide

ScheduleFlow is a command line application for university students balancing coursework deadlines, project work, and recurring classes. Add your tasks and weekly commitments, then generate a study plan that allocates work to available time before each deadline.

Study hours are **08:00–22:00 every day**, including weekends. Work is scheduled in **30-minute slots**, and any work that does not fit is reported explicitly.

> **Guide baseline:** This guide describes the MVP behaviour specified in *ScheduleFlow implementation contract*, version 1, dated 27 September 2026. The contract specifies intended behaviour; it is not evidence that the application has already implemented every feature.

## Quick start

1. Install **Java 25**. Check your version in a terminal:

   ```shell
   java -version
   ```

2. Obtain `scheduleflow.jar` from the project's release distribution and place it in a dedicated folder.

3. Open a terminal in that folder and launch the application:

   ```shell
   java -jar scheduleflow.jar
   ```

   The application takes no additional command line arguments.

4. At the `scheduleflow>` prompt, type `help` and press Enter. Do not type the prompt itself.

5. Add a task and a recurring commitment, generate a plan, then view today's schedule:

   ```text
   task add n/CS2113 draft due/2026-10-06 1800 d/180
   commitment add n/CS2113 lecture day/MON start/1000 d/120
   plan
   schedule today
   ```

   Replace the example deadline with a future date within the [allowed date range](#planning-hours-and-date-range) when necessary.

6. Enter `exit` when finished. Successful task and commitment changes are already saved automatically.

## Command format

Enter each command on one line. In syntax examples, uppercase placeholders such as `NAME` and `MINUTES` are values you replace. Terminal transcripts include the `scheduleflow>` prompt; copy only the command after it.

| Input | Rule | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commands and prefixes | Case sensitive and lowercase | `task add`, `n/`, `due/`, `d/` |
| Fields | All shown fields are required and must appear in the stated order | `n/NAME due/DATE_TIME d/MINUTES` |
| Names | Nonblank; may contain spaces and Unicode, but no `/`, tabs, newlines, or other control characters | `CS2113 draft` |
| Dates | Real dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format; years `0001`–`9999` | `2026-10-06` |
| Times | Four digits in 24-hour `HHmm` format, from `0000` to `2359` | `0930`, `1800` |
| Deadlines | Date and time separated by a space; any minute is allowed | `2026-10-06 2359` |
| Durations | Positive whole minutes, divisible by 30; no sign or leading zeroes | `30`, `90`, `180` |
| Commitment starts | Must be on the hour or half hour | `1000`, `1030` |
| Weekdays | Exactly `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU`, `FRI`, `SAT`, or `SUN` | `MON` |
| Task IDs | `T` followed by a positive integer, without leading zeroes | `T1`, `T12` |
| Commitment IDs | `C` followed by a positive integer, without leading zeroes | `C1`, `C12` |

Use one or more ordinary spaces between fields. Outer whitespace is trimmed, and blank lines are ignored. Names are trimmed at both ends while retaining internal spaces. Quotation marks have no special meaning and are unnecessary. Duplicate names are allowed.

IDs identify records, not list positions. Bare numbers such as `1`, zero-padded IDs such as `T01`, and IDs with the wrong prefix are rejected. Task and commitment IDs have separate sequences starting at `T1` and `C1`. Deleted IDs are never reused, including after a restart; a failed add does not consume an ID. Numeric inputs must fit within a signed 32-bit integer, and an exhausted ID sequence rejects further additions.

Missing, repeated, unknown, reordered, or extra fields are rejected. Commands such as `help`, `task list`, `plan`, and `exit` accept no arguments. Deletion and schedule commands also reject trailing input.

Examples below are independent unless a sequence is explicitly described. Use existing IDs and suitable future dates in your own session. List spacing and explanatory error wording may vary; identifiers, values, and behaviour follow the contract.

## Tasks

Every stored task represents unfinished work. Its duration is your estimate of the work still required. Generating a plan or letting time pass does not reduce that estimate.

### Adding a task

**Command:** `task add`

```text
task add n/NAME due/YYYY-MM-DD HHmm d/MINUTES
```

The deadline must be strictly later than the current local date and time and no later than midnight at the start of the same calendar date next year. The duration must be a positive multiple of 30 minutes. Deadlines do not need to fall on a half-hour boundary.

```text
scheduleflow> task add n/CS2113 draft due/2026-10-06 1800 d/180
Added T1: CS2113 draft
Due: 2026-10-06 18:00 | Duration: 180 min
```

A missing deadline is rejected. For example:

```text
scheduleflow> task add n/CS2113 draft d/180
Error: Invalid command format or missing fields
Expected: task add n/NAME due/YYYY-MM-DD HHmm d/MINUTES
```

A successful addition saves the task and clears any current plan. Run `plan` again to include it.

### Listing tasks

```text
task list
```

Lists all stored tasks, including overdue tasks, in ascending numeric ID order. Each row shows the ID, name, duration, and deadline.

```text
scheduleflow> task list
=== Actionable Tasks ===
ID | Name                | Duration | Deadline
T1 | CS2113 draft        | 180 min  | 2026-10-06 18:00
T2 | EE2026 preparation  | 90 min   | 2026-10-07 12:00
Total: 2 task(s).
```

An empty list displays:

```text
No tasks found.
```

The listed duration is the stored work estimate, not the unallocated remainder of the latest plan.

### Deleting a task

```text
task delete TNUMBER
```

Deletes the task permanently. Use this command to remove completed work or to remove an incorrect task before adding a replacement. There is no undo or completion command.

```text
scheduleflow> task delete T1
Deleted task T1: CS2113 draft
```

The ID must belong to an existing task. A successful deletion saves the change and clears the current plan. A rejected deletion leaves both unchanged.

## Recurring commitments

A commitment reserves the same period every week until it is deleted. Add separate entries for commitments on different weekdays.

### Adding a commitment

```text
commitment add n/NAME day/DAY start/HHmm d/MINUTES
```

```text
scheduleflow> commitment add n/CS2113 lecture day/MON start/1000 d/120
Added C1: CS2113 lecture | Monday 10:00 - 12:00 (120 min)
```

This blocks 10:00–12:00 every Monday.

- The start must be on `:00` or `:30`, and the duration must be a positive multiple of 30 minutes.
- A commitment must end by midnight on its selected day. Ending exactly at midnight is allowed and displayed as `24:00`; entering `2400` as a start time is invalid.
- Commitments may occur outside study hours. A full-day commitment starting at `0000` with duration `1440` is valid.
- Commitments on the same weekday must not overlap, even outside study hours. An overlap error identifies the existing commitment.
- Adjacent commitments are allowed: Monday 10:00–12:00 and Monday 12:00–13:00 do not overlap. The same time on different weekdays is also allowed.

A successful addition saves the commitment and clears the current plan.

### Listing commitments

```text
commitment list
```

Lists commitments by weekday, Monday through Sunday, then by start time and numeric ID. Empty weekday groups are omitted. The displayed IDs remain the original commitment IDs.

```text
scheduleflow> commitment list
=== Recurring Weekly Commitments ===
[Monday]
C1. 10:00 - 12:00 | CS2113 lecture
C2. 12:00 - 13:00 | EE2026 lecture

[Friday]
C3. 23:30 - 24:00 | Weekly review

Total: 3 recurring commitments across the week.
```

An empty list displays:

```text
No commitments found.
```

### Deleting a commitment

```text
commitment delete CNUMBER
```

Removes the entire weekly series, not just one occurrence.

```text
scheduleflow> commitment delete C1
Deleted commitment C1: CS2113 lecture
```

A successful deletion saves the change and clears the current plan. Run `plan` again to make the released time available for study sessions.

## Study plans

### Generating a plan

```text
plan
```

ScheduleFlow allocates tasks by earliest deadline first. Tasks with equal deadlines are ordered by numeric ID: for example, `T2` comes before `T10`.

Each task fills the earliest available 30-minute slots that end at or before its deadline. Work may split around commitments or across days. Adjacent slots for the same task on the same day are displayed as one session. Sessions never overlap commitments or other sessions.

When every task fits:

```text
scheduleflow> plan
Study plan generated successfully! Type 'schedule today' to view your sessions.
```

When there are no tasks:

```text
scheduleflow> plan
No tasks to schedule.
```

Even with no tasks, `plan` creates a current plan. You can then view commitments and free or unplanned periods using `schedule`.

Each `plan` command replaces the previous plan. It does not change stored task durations or save a plan to disk. This allocator follows deadline order; it does not guarantee the fewest sessions or the greatest number of fully completed tasks.

### Planning hours and date range

Study windows are fixed at **08:00–22:00 every local calendar day**, including weekends.

For the day on which you generate a plan, scheduling starts at the later of 08:00 and the current time rounded up to the next half hour. At or after 22:00, there are no study slots left for that day. Future days start at 08:00.

| Time when `plan` runs | Earliest eligible start that day |
| --- | --- |
| 07:00 | 08:00 |
| 10:00:00 exactly | 10:00 |
| 10:00:01 | 10:30 |
| 10:07 | 10:30 |
| 21:45 | No slots remain; cutoff is 22:00 |

The planning limit is **midnight at the start of the same calendar date next year**, recalculated for each `plan` command. The plan includes the generation date through the day before that limit. Task additions use the same limit, calculated when the task is added.

For example, on 5 October 2026:

- A new task's deadline must be later than the current time and at or before **5 October 2027 at 00:00**.
- A new plan covers **5 October 2026 through 4 October 2027**, inclusive.
- The latest possible study session still ends at **22:00 on 4 October 2027**.

This is a calendar year, not a fixed 365 days. For a 29 February start date, the following year's boundary adjusts to 28 February. There is no first-startup limit and no need to delete saved data to move the range forward.

Dates and times use your computer's local wall time. Time zone offsets are not stored; changing the computer's time zone reinterprets saved times as local times. Durations are wall-clock minutes, including across daylight-saving changes.

### Unallocated work

If work does not fit, ScheduleFlow keeps a **partial plan** and reports the remaining minutes for each affected task. This is a valid planning result. Even a completely blocked task remains in the plan's unallocated-work report.

For example, if a 90-minute task is due at 08:30 and planning runs before 08:00 that day with no commitments:

```text
scheduleflow> plan
Study plan generated with unallocated work.
Scheduled: 30 min | Unallocated: 60 min
T1: Draft | Unallocated: 60 min | Reason: insufficient time before deadline
```

The task still has a stored duration of 90 minutes. Only 30 minutes were allocated in this plan.

| Reported reason | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `deadline passed` | The task's deadline is at or before the time the plan was generated. Its full duration remains unallocated. |
| `outside planning horizon` | The deadline is later than this plan's date limit, for example after restoring data or changing the clock. Its full duration remains unallocated. |
| `insufficient time before deadline` | Too few eligible slots remain before the deadline. Any slots that do fit are retained. |

The totals cover the whole plan. Unallocated tasks appear in deadline order, then numeric ID order. Slots must fit in full: a deadline of 08:59 permits an 08:00–08:30 session but not an 08:30–09:00 session.

## Viewing the schedule

Use either command:

```text
schedule today
schedule YYYY-MM-DD
```

`today` means the computer's current local date when the command runs. A dated command selects that calendar date explicitly.

The schedule displays the latest plan's full 08:00–22:00 window in chronological order, along with the time the plan was generated. Commitments are clipped to the study window: a 07:30–09:00 commitment appears as 08:00–09:00. Commitments entirely outside study hours remain visible in `commitment list` but do not appear in the schedule.

### Schedule labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[TASK]` | A planned study session, showing its task ID, name, and session duration. |
| `[BUSY]` | A recurring commitment, showing its commitment ID and name. |
| `[FREE]` | Time eligible for planning that was not assigned to a task or blocked by a commitment. |
| `[UNPLANNED]` | Time before the planning cutoff on the day the plan was generated. It is not available study time in this plan. |

A commitment remains `[BUSY]` even when it occurred before the planning cutoff. Adjacent entries are combined only when their label, ID, and name match, so separate commitments remain separate rows.

### Worked schedule example

Assume an empty store and that it is **Monday, 5 October 2026 at 07:00**. Run these commands in order:

```text
task add n/CS2113 draft due/2026-10-06 1800 d/180
commitment add n/CS2113 lecture day/MON start/1000 d/120
commitment add n/EE2026 lecture day/MON start/1200 d/60
plan
schedule today
```

The schedule is:

```text
=== Schedule for Monday (2026-10-05) ===
Generated at: 2026-10-05 07:00
08:00 - 10:00 | [TASK] T1: CS2113 draft (120 min)
10:00 - 12:00 | [BUSY] C1: CS2113 lecture
12:00 - 13:00 | [BUSY] C2: EE2026 lecture
13:00 - 14:00 | [TASK] T1: CS2113 draft (60 min)
14:00 - 22:00 | [FREE]
```

The task uses the two free morning hours first, then resumes after the commitments. All 180 minutes fit, so there is no unallocated-work footer.

### Planning partway through the day

If you generate a plan at **10:07** on 5 October 2026 with one 30-minute task named `Draft`, a future deadline within the horizon, and no commitments:

```text
=== Schedule for Monday (2026-10-05) ===
Generated at: 2026-10-05 10:07
08:00 - 10:30 | [UNPLANNED]
10:30 - 11:00 | [TASK] T1: Draft (30 min)
11:00 - 22:00 | [FREE]
UNPLANNED periods were before the planning cutoff.
```

When any work is unallocated, every schedule view also includes a footer for the **whole plan**, even if the affected task is due on another date. For the partial-plan example above, that footer is:

```text
Unallocated work for the whole plan:
T1: Draft | Unallocated: 60 min | Reason: insufficient time before deadline
```

If no plan exists, the app displays:

```text
No current plan. Run plan to generate one.
```

A selected date must fall within the current plan's date range. An out-of-range request reports the earliest and latest allowed dates; it does not produce an empty schedule. Run `plan` again when you need a fresh range.

**Plans remain fixed until regenerated.** Viewing a schedule later does not move its sessions, update its generation time, or account for completed work. Successful task or commitment additions and deletions clear the plan; failed commands preserve it. Restarting also clears the plan.

## Help and exit

### Viewing help

```text
help
```

Displays `=== ScheduleFlow Command Help ===`, followed by every supported command format and a short description. See the [command summary](#command-summary) for the full list.

### Exiting the program

```text
scheduleflow> exit
Goodbye for now!
```

`exit` closes the application without another save because successful changes have already been saved. End of input also prints the same goodbye message and exits normally. Extra arguments, such as `exit extra`, are rejected and the application keeps running.

## Saving and restoring data

Tasks, commitments, and the next ID counters are saved automatically after each successful addition or deletion and restored at startup. No manual save or load command is needed.

- **Location:** `data/scheduleflow.txt`, relative to the folder from which you launch the application. Launch from the same folder to use the same data.
- **First launch:** If the file is absent, the app starts empty. The first successful change creates the saved data.
- **Temporary plans:** Plans are not saved. Run `plan` after restarting.
- **Failed save:** The change is rejected. Existing tasks, commitments, ID counters, saved data, and the current plan remain unchanged. Resolve the reported file or folder problem, then retry.
- **Invalid or unreadable file:** The app reports an error and stops before accepting commands. It preserves the file instead of silently starting empty or loading only part of it.
- **Overdue tasks:** Valid saved tasks remain available after their deadlines pass. Replanning reports their work as unallocated with reason `deadline passed`.

Use one running instance per data file. Saving requires a filesystem that supports atomic file replacement; if it does not, the app reports a save error and retains the previous data.

To back up your data, close the app and copy `data/scheduleflow.txt`. To transfer it, place the copy in the destination launch folder's `data` subfolder and use the Java 25 and JAR setup described in [Quick start](#quick-start). Back up any existing destination file before replacing it.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### What if my work does not fit before its deadline?

Run `plan` and review the unallocated minutes and reasons. The app retains every session that fits. You can correct an estimate or deadline by deleting the task and adding a replacement, or remove a commitment if that time has become available. Run `plan` again after changes.

### How do I mark work as complete or correct an entry?

Delete completed tasks using `task delete TNUMBER`. To correct a task or commitment, delete it and add a replacement with the correct details; the replacement gets a new ID. There are no edit or completion commands. For partially completed work, replace the task with your revised remaining-work estimate.

### Why did my schedule disappear?

A successful task or commitment addition or deletion clears the current plan. Plans also disappear when the application restarts. Run `plan` to generate another one.

### Can I change the study hours or slot size?

The MVP uses fixed study hours of 08:00–22:00 and 30-minute slots. These settings are not configurable.

### Can I schedule more than a year ahead?

New task deadlines must fall within the rolling calendar-year limit at the time of addition. Wait until the deadline enters that range before adding it. Each new plan recalculates its range; you do not need a reset or data deletion.

### Why was my command rejected?

Check the command's field order, case, prefixes, date, time, duration, and ID. Syntax errors display `Error: MESSAGE` followed by `Expected: USAGE`. Value errors, unknown IDs, and save errors display one `Error: MESSAGE` line. Rejected operations preserve saved data and the current plan.

For example, use `task delete T1`, not `task delete 1`; use duration `60`, not `45` or `060`; and start a commitment at `1030`, not `1015`.

### What should I do if the application cannot load my data?

Keep a backup of the reported file, resolve access problems, or restore a known-good backup before restarting. A malformed or unreadable file is a startup error; the app will not overwrite it with an empty store.

## Command summary
